        <p>
          OSINT framework focused on gathering information from free tools or
          resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT resources.
          Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more
          data for $$$, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the
          available information for no cost.

          I originally created this framework with an information security point
          of view. Since then, the response from other fields and disciplines
          has been incredible. I would love to be able to include any other
          OSINT resources, especially from fields outside of infosec. Please let
          me know about anything that might be missing!
